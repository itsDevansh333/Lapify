# Customize Your New Tab Landing Page on Your Browser

Here I will show you how you can customize your new tab landing page on your browser.

I will be using **Microsoft Edge**, but the same process works for **Google Chrome**.

## Step 1: Create a Customized Web Page

You need to create a customized web page using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

In my example, I have created a web page with:
- A **digital clock** in the center.
- A **welcome quote** below it.

You can take this same page as it is or create your own.

## Step 2: Follow These Steps to Create the Extension

1. **Make an empty folder** on your laptop, wherever you want.
2. **Open Notepad**, paste the **HTML code**, and save the file with a `".html"` extension in the same folder.
3. **Open Notepad** again, paste the **CSS code**, and save the file in the same folder with a `".css"` extension.
4. **Open Notepad** again, paste the **JavaScript code**, and save the file in the same folder with a `".js"` extension.
5. **Open Notepad** again, paste the code from `Manifest.json` (provided in the repository), place your HTML file in place of `index.html`, and save it in the same folder.

Now, this folder will act as your **new browser extension**.

3. Turn on the **Developer Mode**.
